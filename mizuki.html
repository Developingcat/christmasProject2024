    <p>Mizuki is one of my favorite characters from Nightcord at 25:00, they're the main MV composer and their story is SO GOOD. So basically, Mizuki has this big secret about their idenity that they've hidden from the entire group, Ena in one of the story confronts Mizuki about this, to which Ena says she'll wait for them to be comfortable sharing. Mizu5 and Ena5 were about it, pretty much. One of the students made an unjust comment about Mizuki, when Mizuki wanted to talk to Ena about the secret, and before the two could talk, Mizuki ran off; leaving Ena, Mafuyu and Kanade to try and look for them. After a while, Ena and Mizuki eventually find one another again and they talk about the entire thing, Ena tells Mizuki that the secret doesn't matter, and that she cares about them because they're Mizuki and nobody else and that she'll always care about them. Ena5 is literally one of my favorite events ever.</p>
