    <h4>$27.69</h4>
    <p>A Cabin Fever themed necklace from one of my favorite indie-shows! Murder Drones was something I got into a little over a year ago and I pretty much fell in love with the show, hint the jacket I wear around continously. (The one with the battery, not the one currently.) <br> This would honestly be the only piece of jewlery I think I'd ever wear, it honestly looks really cool and judging by the reviews, it looks really well made as well.</p>
