        <p>One of my favorite horror games to date, it's anniversary is actually on Christmas funnily enough. It also comes with a music box, so I would be able to go asleep to the sound of the horrors and I think that'd be pretty neat. It's a game that explores psychological trauma in a creative way, such as exploring a dreamscape. It's overall very interesting, and it's worth checking out!</p>
