                <p>Firefly is a character from one of my favorite games, her banner is being ran literally on Christmas as well so I think it'd be cool if I got Firefly for Christmas....so it's like two Firefly's. Also I literally have so many of these, I love them dearly.</p>

She's from one of my favorite units in my favorite rythm game, and I absolutely adore these little keychains-- I think the company also made the Honkai StarRail ones, which is really cool and I really like the quality of them, they're considerably cheap and I sound like an ad.</p>
