    <p>Cyn is one of my favorite characters from Murder Drones, they're one of the more tragic ones. Cyn was essentially a worker drone (drones made to serve for humans in Murder Drones, back when humans existed) but she was scrapped into a drone graveyard improperly, so her coding I believe got corrupted and after that she essentially became the host for the robot equivlant to an eldritch horror. The Absolute Solver (eldritch horror stated priorly) used her as a puppet, pretty much before the Gala where this thing is implied to have stolen someones literal skin, still using Cyn as a puppet and then parade around, disguising itself as Tessa (the human at the gala), Murder Drones can be argued to be a commentary on ai dangers possibly. And I think you should watch it (please watch it.) </p>
