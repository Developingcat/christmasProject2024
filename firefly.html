    <h3>$17.99</h3>
    <p>Firefly is one of my favorite characters from Honkai Starrail, she's literally the sweetest ever and has done nothing wrong I've decided. She's biologically modified to be a form of machine for war (also known as SAM.) and suffers from Entropy Loss Syndrome, her whole character is about trying to find ways for her to persist past it and enjoy herself in what ways she can, and I think she's just overall fascinating.</p>
