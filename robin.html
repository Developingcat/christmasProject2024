    <p>Robin is another one of my favorite characters from Honkai Starrail! She's a famous singer in the game she's from, and her whole thing is spreading messages on harmony. Robin has some really interesting lore, such as the fact that a Stellaron (basically a cancer for planets) destroyed her home. Her and her brother, Sunday, were both taken in by The Oak Family, proclaiming they were children of the Harmony while the Oak Family didn't serve under the Harmony Aeon, Xipe's, gaze (aeons are gods, by the way) and instead serve under the fallen Aeon of Order's gaze, who is named Ena. Robin left because of tours and such, nearly dying in the process in order to help other planets, while Sunday stayed behind to become the new head of the Oak Family and serve under the fallen Aeon, Ena's gaze.  </p>
