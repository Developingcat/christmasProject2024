    <p>N25 is one of my favorite fictional units out there, and like a normal person I was in the 0.01% of listeners this fictional band has on Spotify. If you played one of the songs, I could probably tell you what the song is without looking at the title. Nightcord at 25:00 is from a game called Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage, more commonly known as Project:Sekai. They're a group of four people who work at 1am in order to produce songs to help people connect to their feelings better and give them a feeling of relation, Yoisaki Kanade is the unit founder and main composer, Asahina Mafuyu is the lyricist, Akiyama Mizuki is the MV maker and Shinonome Ena is the illustrator. They've also done a few covers of songs written by other artists (also referred to as Commissions); please ignore how low quality the image is, it makes me sad. </p>
