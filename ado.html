        <p>Ado is one of my favorite artists, they aren't exactly associated with Hatsune Miku but they've done a few song covers with her. Their songs are really good and Ado's vocal range is terrifying sometimes, espeically in Aishite Aishite Aishite-- they go from regular singing to pretty much rage singing, and it's something admirable, because I don't think a lot of singers can do that.</p>
