    <p>Yoisaki Kanade is another one of my favorite characters, main founder of Nightcord at 25:00 she composes in order to try and save other people, her background is so interesting and tragic, and I can't wait for her healing arc. Basically, Kanade's entire thing is that she blames herself for her father basically overworking himself into a coma, so she composes music in order to save other people and tries to help them all with a feeling of understanding. She's a people pleaser at most, and she deserves a hug. Kanade puts music over pretty much anything and spends most her days composing, it's stated in a trivia section in her wiki page that she has a light sensitivity issue BUT she can scarily tell the time with no clock nearby.</p>
